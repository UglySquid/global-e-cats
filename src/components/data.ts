          These policies helped nurture the local car industry, allowing Brazilian companies to grow and eventually compete with global manufacturers. The protectionist measures helped preserve domestic jobs and fostered the growth of local industries that might have been unable to compete with more established foreign car manufacturers in the early stages.`,

          The government used tariffs and subsidies to support domestic carmakers, which allowed Hyundai and Kia to gain market share domestically. Over time, as these companies became more competitive, South Korea opened its market to international competition, leading to the successful global expansion of its car brands.`
